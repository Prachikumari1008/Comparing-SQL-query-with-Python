## SQL 
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language specifically designed for accessing and interacting with databases. It allows users to create tables, modify data, and retrieve information in a fast and efficient manner.

## Database 
A database is a collection of organised data that can be easily stored, sorted, retrieved and searched. 

## Database Management System
A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.

DBMS provides an environment to store and retrieve the data in coinvent and efficient manner.

## Database Languages
1. Data Definition Language (DDL):

     CREATE: Creates new database objects such as tables, indexes, views, or stored procedures.
     ALTER: Modifies the structure of existing database objects, such as adding or dropping columns from a table.
     DROP: Deletes existing database objects such as tables or indexes.
     TRUNCATE: Removes all data from a table but retains the table structure.

 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML):

     INSERT: Adds new rows of data into a table.
     UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table by changing the values of specific columns in one or more rows.
     DELETE: Removes one or more rows of data from a table.

 3. Data Control Language (DCL):

      GRANT: Provides specific privileges to database users or roles.
      REVOKE: Removes specific privileges from database users or roles.
    
4.  Transaction Control Language (TCL):

      COMMIT: Saves changes made during the current transaction to the database.
      ROLLBACK: Reverts the database to its state before the start of the current transaction.
      SAVEPOINT: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
   
5.  Data Query Language (DQL):

     SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables based on specified criteria.
